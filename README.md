### wrangler

This repository contains my experiments in data wrangling with Python, R and SQL. 

- R data wrangling libraries
	- `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, `plyr`, `reshape2`
- MySQL  
- Python data wrangling library
	- `pandas`

- R version:

    > version
    R version 4.0.0 (2020-04-24)
    

- Python version

Executing the command `python -V`in command prompt gives `Python 3.7.6`

- MySql version

Executing the command `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "%version%";` in mysql commandline tool gives `8.0.20`

The one common issue which novice entrants in data science have always asked me is, "How to begin their data analysis journey?".
My answer has always been the same, "Tell a data powered story!". But, one will be in a position to tell a "story" only if he/she knows the *nuts and bolts* of the story. If you are a *novice* in statistics or applied mathematics, I recommend to check out the `resources` folder, first.

The repository contains `data`, `code`, `resources` and `plots` folders.
